# Secure Computing Practices
Unlike the projects listed in this repository, this folder contains reports and a presentation discussing secure computing practices and potential attacks. Included are a total of three in-depth reports, and a single presentation.

- [Report 01](https://github.com/AMoore86/Portfolio/blob/main/Secure%20Computing%20Practices%20-%20Reports/Report01.docx)
  - Report 01 discusses multiple extortion ransomware, particularly double extortion ransomware. This is a more malicious form of ransomware that is more of a danger to any potential victim.
- [Report 02](https://github.com/AMoore86/Portfolio/blob/main/Secure%20Computing%20Practices%20-%20Reports/Report02.docx)
  - Report 02 discusses cyber-risk management, an ongoing process of identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and addressing an organizationâ€™s cybersecurity threats. This includes both proactive and reactive methods to (potential) cybersecurity attacks.
- [Report 03](https://github.com/AMoore86/Portfolio/blob/main/Secure%20Computing%20Practices%20-%20Reports/Report03.docx)
  - Report 03 discusses virtual dispersive networking (VDN), a novel and potentially more secure method for wireless devices to communicate over the network.
- [Presentation - VDN](https://github.com/AMoore86/Portfolio/blob/main/Secure%20Computing%20Practices%20-%20Reports/Virtual%20Dispersive%20Networking.pptx)
  - This presentation is a condensed version of Report 03, expressing some main points discussed in the report.
